# Psychbot-chatbot
Employed NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques to analyze user-provided data, predicting mental
health outcomes and providing advice or suggestions for appropriate help when needed.

Requirements:
To run this Natural Language Processing (NLP) project, ensure you have the following tools and libraries installed:

Software and Tools:
Python 3.8+: The project is built using Python. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.
Jupyter Notebook: The project is developed in Jupyter Notebook, which provides an interactive environment for executing code.

Python Libraries:
Install the following Python libraries using pip or conda:
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NLTK: The Natural Language Toolkit, a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data.
spaCy: For advanced NLP tasks like named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, etc.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning tasks such as text classification and clustering.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
TensorFlow/PyTorch (optional): For deep learning tasks in NLP, such as building custom models.

Additional Setup:
Download Language Models: If using spaCy, download the necessary language models:
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
NLTK Data: For certain tasks, you may need to download additional NLTK data:
python -m nltk.downloader all
